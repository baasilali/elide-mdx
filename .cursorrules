# Elide MDX Project Rules

## Documentation Structure

- All documentation content is in `content/docs/` as MDX files
- Navigation structure is defined in `lib/docs-config.ts`
- Each doc must have a corresponding entry in the config
- Use frontmatter for metadata (title, description, date)

## Adding New Documentation

1. Create `.mdx` file in `content/docs/`
2. Add entry to `lib/docs-config.ts`
3. Use descriptive slugs (lowercase, hyphenated)
4. Include proper frontmatter

## React Components in MDX

- All `components/ui/` components are available
- Import at the top of MDX files
- Use proper TypeScript types for custom components
- Test components before using in docs

## Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- MDX content styled with `.mdx-content` class
- Maintain dark mode compatibility
- Follow existing component patterns

## File Organization

- New components go in `components/`
- UI components in `components/ui/`
- Utilities in `lib/`
- MDX files only in `content/docs/`
- No other documentation formats

## Best Practices

- Keep MDX files focused and concise
- Use code examples liberally
- Include working examples, not pseudocode
- Cross-reference related docs
- Keep navigation hierarchy clear
